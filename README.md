### THE FOLLOWING TASKS ASKED WERE: 📃💻

1- Notification Panel: paragraph and button, the panel should stay in the top of the page as the page is scrolled and when we click the button 'got it' just sliding up and 'desapiers', it was to display back right after we refresh the page, I had to use vanila in the function that provide the slide effect;

2- Page header: logo, paragraphs, and call to action button, there is an hover effect in the button;

3- Highlights Panel: I've used font awesome for the icons, each card contains title, icon, and paragraph;

4- Page Footer: I just did a copyright icon right after my name, and used flexbox as well;

5- Newsletter Panel: Here it was a great challange, and I am very happy that I've learned how to do it! This panel sliding down slowly as the 'header' , and if we refresh the website, keeps hidden for few minutes, and in order to do this I've used local storage and other functions related to the date, time, minutes and seconds! Also I had to display this panel only from the third part of the website!! Very cool right?!
